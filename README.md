# SUDOKU SOLVER
A Python project for solving Sudoku puzzles automatically. It uses computer vision and a deep learning model (PyTorch) to detect and solve Sudoku puzzles from images or webcam input.
## Features
- Load Sudoku puzzle from an image file or Capture Sudoku puzzle from webcam.
- Detect and extract Sudoku grid and digits using image processing techniques.
- Use a trained deep learning model to recognize digits.
- Solve the puzzle and display the solution.
- Simple and user-friendly GUI.

```
## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Libraries in requirements.txt.
## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/photienanh/Sudoku-Solver
cd Sudoku-Solver
```
Alternatively, download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.
### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python is installed. If not, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. (Optional) If you want to train your own digit recognition model:
    - Run ```python digit_dataset_generation.py``` to generate the digit dataset for training.
    - Run ```python digit_recognition_train.py``` to train the digit recognition model.
    > **Note:** These steps can be skipped because a pre-trained model (`Model/digit_cnn.pth`) is already included.

2. To start the application:
    - Run `main.py` to open the graphical user interface and begin using the Sudoku Solver.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
### Webcam Instructions
- Press **SPACE** to capture an image of the Sudoku puzzle from your webcam.
- Press **ESC** to cancel.
- Make sure the Sudoku grid is clearly visible for accurate detection.

### Image Upload Instructions
- Select the option to upload an image file containing the Sudoku puzzle.

After selecting the Sudoku image using either method above, click **"Giải Sudoku"** to process and solve the puzzle. The solved Sudoku board will then be displayed clearly in the application.

⚠️ **Notes**
- Ensure the Sudoku grid is well-lit and clear for best results.
- Blurry or handwritten digits may affect digit recognition accuracy.
